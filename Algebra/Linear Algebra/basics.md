# Familiarizing Oneself with vectors

# Some important inequalities (in Euclidean Space)
1. Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality (first transform the relation into an equivalent one defined using unit vectors.)
2. Triangle Inequality (Follows easily once you have the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality)
3. Alternate Definition of the dot product using cosine (proof uses Law of Cosines.)
